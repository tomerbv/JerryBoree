As part of advanced programming course I have implemented a "rick and morty" themed interactive system.

The systems allows various fumctionalities to store, access, delete and manipulate the different entities in the complex data structures it holds.
all of which is done with responsible allocation and freeing of space.

## the data structures implemented alone in this project include:
- Linked list
- Key Value Pair
- Hash Table
- Multi Value Hash Table (a combination of all 3 structures)
